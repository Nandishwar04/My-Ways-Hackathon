Real-Time Chat with Task Board Application
This application, built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Nodejs), allows remote teams to have real-time conversations and manage tasks. It consists of two main features: a real-time chat room and a Kanban-style task board.
This application aims to facilitate team collaboration for remote teams. Users can log in, join different chat rooms, and create new rooms for chat. They also create, edit, move, and delete tasks on a shared Kanban board. All updates on the Kanban board are visible in to all users in the same room.
